My topic for Project 1 will focus on evaluating COVID deaths per positive case by county in Indiana. The points of comparison will first be air quality as measured by PPM of ozone over a 8-hour basis for 2021 (the most recent data provided by the EPA). My second point of comparison will be whether having a steel mill in a given county raises the risk of COVID deaths per positive case. My hypothesis is that, since ozone pollution has been linked to respiratory issues, and since steel mills tend to output a fair amount of NOx/ozone pollution, counties with steel mills will have a higher death rate.

Counties that either had no ozone pollution data or no CVOID data available were excluded from the data sets that will be used for analysis.
